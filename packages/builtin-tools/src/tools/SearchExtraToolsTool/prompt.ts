## Two-step workflow (MUST follow exactly)

Deferred tools CANNOT be called directly. You MUST use this two-step pattern:

Step 1 — Search: Call this tool (SearchExtraTools) to discover the target tool. The response lists the matched deferred tool names.

Step 2 — Execute: Call ExecuteExtraTool with {"tool_name": "<name>", "params": {...}} to run the discovered tool and get the actual result.

If you don't know the exact tool name, use keyword search first, then execute the best match.

## Query forms
- "select:CronCreate" — exact tool name (fastest, preferred when you know the name from <available-deferred-tools>)
- "select:CronCreate,CronList" — comma-separated multi-select
- "discover:schedule cron job" — returns tool name + description + schema without loading. Use to understand a tool before calling it.
- "notebook jupyter" — keyword search, up to max_results best matches
- "+slack send" — require "slack" in the name, rank by remaining terms

## Failure policy
If ExecuteExtraTool fails, do NOT re-search for the same tool — it will loop. Stop and tell the user what failed.`
