   * tail window but will fall out once the post-compaction session grows.
   * Skipping the re-append would defeat the purpose of this call. Fields

//  - Compaction (useLogMessages): new CB/summary appear FIRST, then recorded
//    messagesToKeep → not a prefix → not tracked → CB gets parentUuid=null
//    (correct: truncates --continue chain at compact boundary).
